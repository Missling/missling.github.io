          <h2>Chef's Kitchen</h2>

          <p>
            I am excited to continue my journey with Dev Bootcamp after listening to Shereef's Fireside Chat. It was great to be reassured that Dev Bootcamp is constantly improving their curriculum, with more material being covered currently than in the previous cohorts. By shedding light on the topic of restaurant versus kitchen view, I hope to be awared if I ever develop the restaurant mentality. I understand that Dev Bootcamp isn't a restaurant. No one should expect to write a check to Dev Bootcamp and assume all the knowledge they need to be a programmer will be delivered to them on a silver platter.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Dev Bootcamp is a place where people can turn their dreams of becoming a web developer into a reality. However, the process will not be easy and what I will gain from the program will be dependent on how much time, energy and sweat I put in. With that said, I plan on giving Dev Boocamp my 100%. The notion of quitting a secure job to pursue something with so many uncertainties still sounds crazy to me. I plan on doing all the work that is asked of me. I plan on spending those long hours onsite coding. I plan on helping out my fellow classmates. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Dev Bootcamp encourages each cohort to be a strong, supportive community, which is evident by just the comments that I see in our Google+ community. It is refreshing to see fellow classmates so opened to helping one another. I know Dev Bootcamp’s staff members are knowledgeable and also eager to help the students. So Dev Bootcamp is providing the foundation and resources for students to succeed. My expectation towards Dev Bootcamp hasn’t changed, because I heard great thing about Dev Bootcamp from past graduates prior to joining. So I have high expectation of Dev Bootcamp and so far Dev Bootcamp seems to be meeting my expectation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Am I nervous? OF COURSE! I am guilty of having imposter syndrome. I fear holding back my partner during pair-programming. I fear not grasping concepts that seemed to be so easy for fellow classmates. I fear sounding stupid when asking for help. I fear I can’t keep up with the material and I'm asked to leave Dev Bootcamp. My biggest demon is really myself. I’m glad Shereef addressed these issues in his chat. It was great to be reminded that everyone is a beginner like myself. Although some might learn faster on one topic, there will be others that will understand another topic quicker. In the end, everyone is really on the same boat together, trying to arrive at the same destination.
