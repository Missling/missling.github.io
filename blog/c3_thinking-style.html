  <a><h1>Thinking Style and Learning</h1></a>
  <h5>January 10, 2015</h5>
  <!--Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

  Now, contemplate the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.-->

      Three weeks has passed since I started Dev Bootcamp, and I find myself better adjusted to Phase 0. So far, my biggest struggle has been finding a balance between working full time and learning the material after work. I credit the improvement with better time management. I am no longer foreign to where I needed to submit my completed challenges, finding a pairing partner, how to sign up for GPS pairing, where to go to leave feedback, etc. So just being familiar with the little things and knowing how to navigate around all the different websites has made my life easier.

      Within the last three weeks, I am astonished at the amount of material I have covered and learned. Prior to starting Phase 0, I took a quiz that determine I was an "Abstract Sequential Thinker", and so far the quiz was spot on. I like to  organize information in a linear fashion, work in a linear way, which is especially true when it came time to code. I like to analyze what I want to achieve, organize a plan of attack, code, and then make sure I understand the logic of my codes before testing. 
    </p>

      I am able to complete all my challenges being an abstract sequential thinker, but I do realize the limitation of being one. I dislike jumping into action without a plan of attack of some sort, even if the plan is small. I need to learn how to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, and just dive right in. That matter of the fact is, once I started, I can always revert back to being a sequential thinker.
