            As statistics have shown, the percentage of women in the technology sector pales in comparsion to the male presence in the same industry. It is said that the tech industry grows at a rate three times faster than any other private sectors of the economy. Yet, why is it that women only make up 29% of the workforce? Among all the Computer Science Degrees awarded to undergraduates, only 18% were earned by women. This percentage is a significant drop from 1980s when the number of women awarded Computer Science Degrees peaked at 37%.

            Being a Bay Area resident, I am fortunate enough to have access to meetups and workshops that are gear towards women interested in programming. It was at these events that I met some of the smartest women. However, I realized there was a good number of us at these events that did not pursue a Computer Science degree in college. When asked why, I notices a common theme that kept reappearing. These women, including myself, were not expose to coding, or even have the slightly idea what coding until after we graduated. Usually the conversations progress to, "I wish I learned about coding sooner."

            I believe one way to rectify the gender gap issue is to foster the interest of programming within girls at a young age. The misconception that girls are not interested in technology is detrimental to making any progress addressing the issue. The time I spent at these workshops and meetups prove otherwise, but it is unfortunate that we found out about this interest later on in life. It would be beneficial if Computer Science courses were more accessible to middle school and high school students. This early exposure will help make programming less foreign to girls and encourage them to consider programming as a career option.
