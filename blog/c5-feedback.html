  <a><h1>Pair Programming</h1></a>
  <h5>January 25, 2015</h5>
 
    <p>
     Dev Bootcamp, being an intensive 19 week program, aim to teach their students the necessary technical skills to be job-ready as a junior developer. Given the time constraint of only 19 weeks, Dev Bootcamp places a strong emphasis of pair-programming to accelerate learning. So two weeks into Phase 0, I was already participating in my first pairing session. Since then, I have come to embrace pairing, both the ups and downs that come with the territory.

     Nothing is more rewarding than completing a challenge by the end of a pairing session. However, the process to derive the solution is not always an easy, fluid process. I noticed that by having two sets of eyes, small mistakes, such as syntax errors are quickly fixed. On the occasions that one person is confused about a method or a block of codes, their partner can always take on the teacher role during the session. With two people working on a challenge, it brings forth a fresh perspective. This is useful for evaluating different options for solving a problem and then deciding what is the most optimized approach. On the other hand, pairing can be a frustrating time. Speaking from my own experience, one major struggle is having a partner who isn’t open to exploring alternative ways of finding a solution. Instead, they try impose their idea during the pairing, convinced that it is the best way, all the while disregarding alternative approaches. Overall, I think the pros of pairing overweighs the cons.

     To help us grow from a pairing session, we give and receive feedback. For myself, I definitely see feedback as a good thing, even if the feedback isn’t always rainbows and butterflies. I can’t view the feedback as a personal attack. Instead, it should be viewed as constructive criticism because my partner wants me to be a better programmer. Feedback are helpful because it brings to my attention areas I should work on that sometimes I am unaware of myself. On the other end of the spectrum, feedback addressing my strengths are definitely ego boaster. In terms of giving feedback, the easiest part is talking about their strengths. However, the difficult part is giving constructive criticism. But if I hold back in my feedback because I fear hurting their feeling, I am doing a disservice to my partner.
