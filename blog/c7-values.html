            When talking about values, especially at times when I am the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the three values that come to mind are growth, accomplishments and economic security. Out of the three listed, I place the biggest emphasis on growth and one way to achieve growth is through learning. Our minds and it’s abilities to learn will never be stagnant, hence it is important to never stop learning. When challenging myself to learn something new, riding out the frustration hurdles, nothing is more rewarding than the moment when all the pieces come together to make sense.

            Recently my friend shared with me the great news that she got accepted into grad school. However, she was hesitant about going, and spent hours weighing the pros and cons. Ultimately I told her the most she will lose if she commits to grad school will be some money and time. I reminded her the knowledge she will gain can only make her a more valuable candidate in the eyes of potential employers and widen her career options.

            It is important to have values because values give me something to strive for in life. There are people that will always be better and faster than myself in a particular area. Rather than have that fact affect me negatively, I will use it as motivation to work harder and push myself for growth. I’ll have to remind myself that they got to their current place through the process of learning. Everybody starts off from the same place of not knowing and with some time and effort, I can also expand my knowledge.
