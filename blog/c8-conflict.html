          <h2>Conflict</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">February 12, 2015</p>
          <p>
          Going into my memory bank, the one conflict that sticks out to me took place years ago. My friend was living in Oakland at the time, and she found an apartment across the bay in San Francisco. She enlisted the help of her friends for the move. I advised my friend to rent a U-Haul truck, pointing to the fact that the U-Haul truck would allow us to complete the move in just a single trip across the bridge. Against my suggestion, she brought up the fact that she calculated the cost and it would be cheaper if she just rented a Zipcar pickup truck to move her bed. She was correct in that it would cost her less, but she failed to factor in the multiple trips her friends, who were nice enough to volunteer their weekend, would have to make multiple trips in their own cars to move her belongings. That meant multiple cars, multiple trips across bridge, multiple bridge tolls, and inefficient use of time and energy.
          </p> 

          <p>
          I was furious at my friend for trying to offset her own cost through her friends. More importantly, since her friends and I were doing her a favor, I felt she should have been more considerate and did anything possible to make the move easier for us. This particular incident made me feel unappreciated and disrespected by my friend, especially with regards to my time and energy. Despite my biggest effort to convince my friend, breaking down the total cost of her plan and sharing my feelings, she still continue with her original plan.
          </p> 

          <p>
          I would classify my friend as having a Type A personality, and most people would find her intimidating. If I could go back in time, I would have tried harder to rally all her friends and convince them to talk to her as well. They all shared the same feeling as myself, but they were too intimidated to express their opinions to her. In the end, I became the spokesperson on their behalf but unfortunately she did not take me seriously. This experience taught me to be appreciative and grateful for anyone that tries to help me.
