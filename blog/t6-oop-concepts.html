  <h5>January 30, 2015</h5>
    <p>
    In the Ruby language, the variable scope determines where a variable is visible within the program. The four types of variable that Ruby support are local variable, instance variable, class variable and global variable. 
    </p>
    <pre>
    $location = oakland

    class House
      @@number_of_house = 0

      def initialize (bedroom, bathroom, lot_area) 
        @bedroom = bedrooms
        @bathroom = bathroom
        @area = area
        @@ number_of_house += 1
      end
  
      def house_value
        bedrooms_value = 20000 * @bedroom
        bathroom_value = 10000 * @bathroom
        area_value = 10 * lot_area
  
        bedrooms_value + bathroom_value + area_value
      end
    end
    </pre>
    <p>
    Local variables are only available in the methods in which they are declared, and not shared across the entire object. A variable can be identified as being a local variable if all the letters in it’s name are lowercase. In the example above, bedrooms_value, bathroom_value, and area_value are all local variables. Those variables do not need to be access outside of the method, therefore it is best to keep them as local variable to limit their accessibility.  
    </p>
    <p> 
    Instance variables are bound to the specific instance of the class. By binding itself to the entire object, an instance variable makes itself available to every methods of the object. Instance variables are prefixed with @ in their name, hence bedroom, bathroom, and area are instance variables. As instance variables, they can be accessed within the house_value method. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Class variables are variables that are shared among the entire class, not just the instances of the class. Class variable will only have one value that exists for every objects created from the class. If one object changes the class variable’s value, then the new value will change for all other instance variables. Class variables are prefixed with @@ in their names. In the above example, number_of_house is a class variable with a default value of 0. With each object instantiated from the House class, number_of_house increases by 1. The new value is then represented by all objects of the House class.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Global variables are accessible from anywhere in the Ruby program. The use of global variables should be limited because global variables can be changed from anywhere, which complicates the debugging process. Global variables can be defined with a prefix $ in from it’s name. In the above example, location is the global variable, which mean location can be access from anywhere.
