  <h1>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
  <h5>December 14, 2014</h5>
    <p>
      Based on what I learned from Shereef’s FIreside Chat, I am excited to continue my journey with Dev Bootcamp. It was great to be reassured that the curriculum is ever changing for the better and that Dev Bootcamp will be covering more material than the previous cohorts. Shareef’s discussion on restaurant verses kitchen view makes me aware of the issue, so during my time at Dev Bootcamp, I hope to realize when I am guilty of the restaurant view so I can change that. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dev Bootcamp is a place that can make people’s dreams of becoming a developer a reality, but it will not be an easy process. I understand that during my time at Dev Bootcamp, there will be a lot of information to be learned, long hours spent coding, and my stress level will be high. With that said, I plan on giving it 110% because it is crazy that I am quitting my job to do this in the first place. I will try to help fellow classmates if they need help and I will be in the classroom 80 hours a week. 
    </p>
      Dev Bootcamp encourages each cohort to be a strong, supportive community, which is evident by just the comments that I see on the google plus community, DBC Sea Lions 2015. It is refreshing to see fellow classmates so opened to helping one another. I know Dev Bootcamp’s staff members are knowledgeable and also eager to help the students. So Dev Bootcamp is providing the foundation and resources for students to succeed. My expectation towards Dev Bootcamp hasn’t changed, because I heard great thing about Dev Bootcamp from past graduates prior to joining. So I have high expectation of Dev Bootcamp and so far Dev Bootcamp seems to be meeting my expectation.

      Am I nervous? OF COURSE! I am guilty of having imposter syndrome. I fear holding back my partner during pair-programming. I fear not grasping concepts that seemed to be so easy for fellow classmates. I fear sounding stupid when asking for help. I fear I can’t keep up with the material and I end up being kicked out of the program. My biggest demon is really myself. I’m glad Shereef addressed these issues in his chat. It was absolutely great to be reminded again that everyone is a beginner like myself. Although some might learn faster on one topic, there will be others that will understand another topic faster. So everyone is really on the same boat together, trying to arrive at the same destination.
