      Version control is an essential tool for any developers, from beginner programmers to senior developers. Version control allows programmers to save a copy of their file at a particular point in time, giving developers the ability to access past versions of their file down the road This makes the debugging process more efficient by allowing developers a way to pin-point the exact version the bug was introduced. Additionally, if a developer decides a new feature does not meet their expectation, they can revert to working on a previous version without the feature and develop from there again. Relating version control to video game, saving a file version is a similar concept to when people save their current position within a videogame before fighting the boss. In the event that the player does die during the battle, the player can just continue from the last place they saved prior to the fight.

      As a version control system, git is able to help me keep track of changes by letting me save the content of my file, at itâ€™s current state, locally. This is achieved through git add, which tells git the modified files and/or new file I want to save by turning it into a tracked file. The last and final step, git commit, will then save any tracked files. By repeating the above steps, I have multiple versions of my file showcasing the changes made to my codes.

      There are many benefits to using Github. Files stored on Github are stored remotely on the internet, allowing users more accessibility. Github is user-friendly because it provides a great visual platform for programmers to view, compare and merge commits. The pull request feature on Github simplifies the merging process in that it allows others to comment and approve code updates before being merged.
